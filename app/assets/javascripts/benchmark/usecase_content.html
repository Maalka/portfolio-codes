        <p>
            Cities across the country are beginning to explore ways to improve the energy efficiency of their building portfolios.
            The process of identifying specific improvement strategies can be long and confusing, spanning multiple levels of
            analysis. The Portfolio Codes Assessment tool was designed to be the first step, by enabling municipalities to
            conduct a quick, simple analysis to understand the typical breakdown of energy end-uses for their buildings and the
            impact that different tiers of investment strategies may have on their overall energy-use and efficiency.

          The MPP team worked with the cities of Providence (RI), Grand Rapids (MI), and Eugene (OR) to develop and refine a process
          for Municipal Strategic Energy Management. Data for buildings across these portfolios, each located in a distinct
          climate zone, was used to calibrate precise energy models for the most common building types found in a municipal portfolio.
