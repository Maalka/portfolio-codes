        <p>
            Cities across the country are beginning to explore ways to improve the energy efficiency of their building portfolios.
            The process of identifying specific improvement strategies can be long and confusing, spanning multiple levels of
            analysis. The Portfolio Codes Assessment tool was designed to be the first step, by enabling municipalities to
            conduct a quick, simple analysis to understand the typical breakdown of energy end-uses for their buildings and the
            impact that different tiers of investment strategies may have on their overall energy-use and efficiency.

    <h1 class="small header">
        <i>How was the Portfolio Codes Tool created?</i>
    </h1>

    <p>
      The MPP team worked with the cities of Providence (RI), Grand Rapids (MI), and Eugene (OR) to develop and refine a process
      for data-driven Strategic Energy Management. The cities were chosen because they could offer perspectives into how energy-usage patterns may vary
        across distinct climate zones.</p>

    <div class="ui hidden divider"></div>

    <div class="ui secondary very padded segment">
        <p>Over time, the team was able to work with each city to collect energy-use data for each building in its portfolio.
        The team normalized the data by building size and grouped buildings by type to statistically determine a representative
        energy-use profile for each building type in the portfolio (See Below - Red lines correspond to representative building).</p>

    <div class="ui hidden divider"></div>

    <div class="ui secondary very padded segment">
        <p>The representative building energy-use profile was then combined with actual meteorological (AMY) data to articulate
        and calibrate a precise energy model for the most common building types found in a municipal portfolio.

        The breakdown of energy end-uses was determined for each building type.
        </p>
    </div>

        <img class="ui centered big image" src="./assets/images/end-use.svg"></p>
    <div class="ui secondary very padded segment">
        <p>
        Finally, several scenarios for improving energy efficiency were tested on the representative energy models and results were
        integrated into the open-source tool.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="ui hidden divider"></div>

    <h1 class="small header">
        <i>What were the scenarios tested on the calibrated models?</i>
    </h1>

    <p>
        Four tiers of improvement strategies, increasing in cost and comprehensiveness, were then applied to the calibrated models and impacts were analyzed.

        Outputs of these calibrated models and simulation were finally integrated into this open-source tool to enable users to understand differences in how buildings across
        climate zones consume energy and how improvement strategies can impact performance across a portfolio.
